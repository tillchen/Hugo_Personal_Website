## Introduction

This post is about some basic machine learning concepts.

### Types of Learning

* Supervised learning
  * In a feature vector $x_i$ (i=1...N), a single feature is denoted by $x^j$ (j=1...D). And $y_i$ is the label.
  * The goal is to produce a model that takes a feature vector x as input and outputs the label.
* Unsupervised learning
* Semi-supervised learning
* Reinforcement learning
